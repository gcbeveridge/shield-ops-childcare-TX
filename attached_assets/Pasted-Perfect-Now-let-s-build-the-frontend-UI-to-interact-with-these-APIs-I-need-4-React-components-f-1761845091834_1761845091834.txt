Perfect! Now let's build the frontend UI to interact with these APIs.

I need 4 React components for the Texas childcare onboarding system:

- Three-column layout:
  Column 1: Day One Status

  Column 2: Week One Check-ins (Days 2-7)
  - List of 6 days with checkmark/pending for each
  - Show completion date for completed days
  - Overall "Week One Complete" badge when all done

  Column 3: Next Steps
  - Shows what needs to be done next
  - Due dates for certifications
  - Countdown timer if anything is overdue

NAVIGATION INTEGRATION:

Add these routes to your main router:
- /onboarding - OnboardingList
- /onboarding/:id/dashboard - NewHireDashboard  
- /onboarding/:id/day-one - DayOneOrientation
- /onboarding/:id/week-one - WeekOneCheckIns

Add "Onboarding" menu item to your main navigation

Please create all 4 components with:
✅ React functional components with hooks
✅ Tailwind CSS styling (match existing app style)
✅ Axios API calls with error handling
✅ Loading states
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ Success/error notifications
✅ Proper routing integration

Let me know when complete and I'll test the full flow!
