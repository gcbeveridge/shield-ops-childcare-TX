Phase 4 Bug Fixes - Form Submissions & Actions Not Working

I've tested the application and found that data DISPLAY works perfectly, but form SUBMISSIONS and ACTION BUTTONS are not saving/updating data. Here are all the issues that need fixing:

## 1. State Licensing - Mark Complete Not Saving
**Issue:** Clicking the checkbox to mark "Annual Training - Directors" as complete doesn't save
**Fix Needed:**
- When checkbox is clicked, call PUT /api/facilities/:facilityId/compliance/:requirementId/complete
- Update the UI immediately (optimistic update)
- Show success message
- Refresh the requirement list

## 2. Staff Management - Add Staff Not Saving
**Issue:** "+ Add Staff" modal opens and form is fillable, but clicking "Add Staff Member" closes modal without saving
**Fix Needed:**
- Form submit should call POST /api/facilities/:facilityId/staff
- Send all form data: { name, email, role, hireDate }
- On success: close modal, refresh staff table, show success message
- On error: show error message, keep modal open

## 3. Incident Reports - Multiple Issues
**Issue A:** Sorting tabs (All/Injuries/Illness/Behavior) don't filter
**Fix Needed:**
- Clicking tabs should filter incidents by type
- Update query parameter and re-fetch from backend with filter

**Issue B:** "+ Log New Incident" doesn't save
**Fix Needed:**
- Form submit should call POST /api/facilities/:facilityId/incidents
- Send: { childName, incidentType, description, occurredAt, reportedBy, actionTaken, parentNotified }
- On success: close modal, refresh incidents table, show success message

## 4. Document Vault - Multiple Issues
**Issue A:** Category tabs don't filter documents
**Fix Needed:**
- Clicking tabs should filter documents by category
- Client-side filtering is fine since all docs are loaded

**Issue B:** "+ Upload Document" doesn't save
**Fix Needed:**
- Form submit should call POST /api/facilities/:facilityId/documents/upload
- Use FormData to send file + metadata
- On success: close modal, refresh documents table, show success message

**Issue C:** Action buttons don't work ("Renew", "View", "Renew Now", "Set Reminder")
**Fix Needed:**
- "View" button: Open document in new tab using GET /api/documents/:documentId/download
- "Renew" / "Renew Now": Open modal to upload new version with extended expiration
- "Set Reminder": Show success message (reminder set for X days before expiration)

## 5. Medication Tracking - Multiple Issues
**Issue A:** "+ Add Medication Authorization" doesn't save
**Fix Needed:**
- Form submit should call POST /api/facilities/:facilityId/medications
- Send all form data including parent authorization
- On success: close modal, refresh medications table

**Issue B:** Child list sorting tabs don't filter
**Fix Needed:**
- Tabs (Active/Today's Log/Expired/Food Allergies) should filter the medications list
- Client-side filtering is fine

**Issue C:** Action buttons don't work ("Log Dose", "Due in 15min", "View Plan")
**Fix Needed:**
- "Log Dose" button: Submit should call POST /api/medications/:medicationId/administer
- Send: { administeredBy, verifiedBy, dosageGiven, administeredAt, notes }
- On success: close modal, refresh medication table, update today's log
- "View Plan": Open modal showing full medication details and administration schedule
- "Due in 15min": Same as "Log Dose" but pre-fill current time

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. All form submissions must include proper error handling
2. Show loading spinners during API calls
3. Display success messages (green toast/alert) on successful saves
4. Display error messages (red toast/alert) on failures
5. Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
6. Validate form data before submission (required fields, valid dates, etc.)
7. Clear form data after successful submission
8. Keep modal open if submission fails so user can correct errors

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
After these fixes, I should be able to:
✅ Mark compliance requirements as complete and see them update
✅ Add new staff members and see them in the table
✅ Create incidents and see them in the list
✅ Upload documents and see them in the vault
✅ Add medication authorizations and see them in tracking
✅ Log medication doses and see updated logs
✅ Filter/sort all tables using the tabs
✅ Click action buttons and see results

Fix all these issues systematically, testing each one after completion.
