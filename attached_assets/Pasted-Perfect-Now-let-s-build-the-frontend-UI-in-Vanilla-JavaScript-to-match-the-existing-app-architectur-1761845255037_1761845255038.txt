Perfect! Now let's build the frontend UI in Vanilla JavaScript to match the existing app architecture.

I need the onboarding UI built with:
- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript (no React/frameworks)
- ✅ HTML partials in backend/public/pages/ or backend/public/partials/
- ✅ CSS matching the existing CAC Design System
- ✅ Integration with your existing js/router.js
- ✅ Modular structure like your other pages

PLEASE CREATE:

1. backend/public/pages/onboarding-list.html
   - Table showing all new hires and their onboarding status
   - Columns: Name, Hire Date, Day One Status, Week One Progress, Overall Status
   - "Add New Hire" button
   - Click row to view dashboard
   - Uses existing table styling

2. backend/public/pages/onboarding-dashboard.html
   - New hire progress overview
   - Three-column layout: Day One, Week One, Next Steps
   - Progress bar showing completion %
   - Status badges using existing badge styles
   - Buttons to start Day One or Week One check-ins

3. backend/public/pages/day-one-orientation.html
   - Step-by-step walkthrough of 7 sections
   - Previous/Next navigation
   - Progress indicator
   - Final sign-off page with signature inputs
   - "Complete Day One" button

4. backend/public/pages/week-one-checkins.html
   - Tab interface for days 2-7
   - Shows activities, verification questions per day
   - Champion notes textarea
   - "Complete Day X" button
   - Visual checkmarks for completed days

5. backend/public/js/onboarding.js
   - JavaScript module for all onboarding functionality
   - API calls using fetch or your existing API utility
   - DOM manipulation
   - Event handlers
   - State management

6. backend/public/css/onboarding.css (if needed)

INTEGRATION:

Update js/router.js to add routes:

- /onboarding/:id/day-one → day-one-orientation.html
- /onboarding/:id/week-one → week-one-checkins.html

Add "Onboarding" link to main navigation
