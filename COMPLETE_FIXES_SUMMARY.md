**Project:** Shield Ops Childcare Management System  
**Status:** All Critical Fixes & Features Complete ‚úÖ

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all bug fixes, feature additions, and upgrades implemented during the post-delivery testing and enhancement phase.

---

## 1. Critical Database Fix: Form Submission Persistence

### Problem
- Staff and medication forms were not persisting to Supabase
- Error: `null value in column 'id' violates not-null constraint`
- Forms appeared to work but data disappeared after page refresh

### Root Cause
- Schema used `uuid_generate_v4()` which requires `uuid-ossp` extension
- Extension not properly enabled in Supabase instance
- UUID generation was failing silently

### Solution
- Updated all 11 tables in `schema-supabase.sql` to use `gen_random_uuid()`
- PostgreSQL 13+ native function (no extension required)
- More reliable and widely supported

### Files Modified
- `backend/config/schema-supabase.sql` - Updated all table definitions
- `backend/scripts/fix-uuid-generation.sql` - Created migration script

### User Action Required
‚úÖ Run `fix-uuid-generation.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to fix existing database

- Created `updateSidebarUserInfo()` function
- Extracts initials for avatar
- Called after login/signup/page load

### Files Modified

## 6. Document Vault - Supabase Storage Migration

### Problem
- Document Vault saved files to local filesystem (`/uploads/`)
- Ephemeral storage in production (Replit restarts = data loss)
- Not production-ready for real childcare centers

### Solution: Complete Cloud Storage Migration

#### Backend Changes
- **Complete controller rewrite** for Supabase Storage integration
- Changed multer from disk storage to memory storage
- Files uploaded directly to Supabase Storage bucket
- Download handles binary files correctly

#### Database Changes
- Added 6 new columns to `documents` table:
  - `storage_path` - Supabase Storage file path
  - `storage_bucket` - Bucket name
  - `file_size` - File size in bytes
  - `mime_type` - MIME type
  - `description` - Document description
  - `tags` - JSONB array for categorization

#### Storage Policies
Created 4 RLS policies:
1. **INSERT**: Authenticated users can upload documents
2. **SELECT**: Users can view their organization's documents
3. **DELETE**: Users can delete their organization's documents
4. **UPDATE**: Users can update their organization's documents

### Files Modified
- `backend/controllers/documentController.js` - Complete rewrite for Supabase Storage
- `backend/config/multerConfig.js` - Changed to memory storage
- `backend/scripts/setup-supabase-storage.sql` - Storage setup script
- `backend/public/js/app.js` - Fixed `downloadDocument()` for binary files

### User Action Required
1. ‚úÖ Create "documents" storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Run `setup-supabase-storage.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

---

## 7. Document Download Fixes

### Problem 1: JSON Parse Error
- Downloads failed with "Unexpected token 'P', 'PK'... is not valid JSON"
- Binary files being parsed as JSON

### Solution
- Rewrote `downloadDocument()` to use `fetch()` with blob handling
- Proper binary file download instead of JSON parsing

### Problem 2: Filename with Trailing Underscore
- Downloaded file named "Victor follow-up.docx_" instead of "Victor follow-up.docx"
- Improper Content-Disposition header parsing

### Solution
- Improved regex pattern for filename extraction
- Added quote removal and trimming
- Now handles quoted and unquoted filenames properly

### Files Modified
- `backend/public/js/app.js` - Fixed `downloadDocument()` function twice
