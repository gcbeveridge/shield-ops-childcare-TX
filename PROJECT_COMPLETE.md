## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1 – Responsive Foundation & Critical Fixes ✅
- Refactored the legacy single-page layout into modular partials aligned with the CAC design system.
- Delivered full mobile responsiveness, quick-action grids, compact hero stats, and modal/table behavior across every screen.
- Repaired core workflows (staff, incident, medication, document forms) and implemented sorting, filtering, dual-staff medication verification, and skeleton/loading states.

### Phase 2 – Data Integrity, Import Workflows & Supabase Migration ✅
- Replaced Replit storage with Supabase-ready scripts, auto-seed utilities, and schema documentation.
- Built CSV templates, multi-step import UI, and bulk API endpoints for staff and medication data.
- Enhanced medication management (photo storage, alerts, audit trails) and produced guides like `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` and `REGULATION_PARSER_GUIDE.md`.

### Phase 3 – Experience Polish, Production Readiness & Documentation ✅
- Finalized dashboard/quick-action redesign, AI chat refinements, and all remaining mobile spacing tweaks.
- Completed production validation, Supabase launch steps, and full repository documentation (`PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `README_SUMMARY.md`, `ROUTING_COMPLETE.md`, `RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md`).
- Audited navigation/auth flows, ensured scroll lock + overlay treatments, and confirmed every module delivers a cohesive CAC-themed experience.
