# Document Vault - Supabase Storage Migration Guide

## Overview
The Document Vault feature has been upgraded from local filesystem storage (ephemeral on Replit) to **Supabase Storage** for production-ready cloud persistence.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Local Filesystem):
- Files saved to: `/uploads/{facilityId}/filename.pdf`
- ❌ **Problem:** Files deleted on Replit restart
- ❌ **Problem:** No backup or redundancy
- ✅ **Good for:** Development/testing only

### After (Supabase Storage):
- Files saved to: Supabase Storage bucket `documents/{facilityId}/filename.pdf`
- ✅ **Persistent:** Files survive restarts
- ✅ **Backed up:** Automatic Supabase backups
- ✅ **Scalable:** Cloud-based CDN delivery
- ✅ **Production ready:** Enterprise-grade storage

---

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Supabase Storage Bucket

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com
   - Select your Shield Ops project

2. **Create the Storage Bucket**
   - Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"New bucket"** button
   - Configure the bucket:
     ```
     Name: documents
     Public: ❌ No (keep private)
     File size limit: 10485760 (10MB)
     Allowed MIME types: 
       - application/pdf
       - image/jpeg
       - image/jpg
       - image/png
       - application/msword
       - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
       - application/vnd.ms-excel
       - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
     ```
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

### Step 2: Configure Storage Policies

1. **Navigate to Storage Policies**
   - In Supabase Dashboard: Storage → Policies
   - Select the `documents` bucket

2. **Run the SQL Script**
   - Go to: SQL Editor
   - Open: `backend/scripts/setup-supabase-storage.sql`
   - Copy the entire SQL script
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"**

   This creates policies for:
   - ✅ Authenticated users can upload
   - ✅ Authenticated users can view their facility's documents
   - ✅ Authenticated users can delete their facility's documents
   - ✅ Authenticated users can update their facility's documents

### Step 3: Update Database Schema

1. **Add Storage Columns to Documents Table**
   - The schema update is already included in the SQL script above
   - It adds two new columns:
     - `storage_path` - Cloud storage path
     - `storage_bucket` - Bucket name (defaults to 'documents')
     - `file_size` - File size in bytes
     - `mime_type` - MIME type
     - `tags` - Array of tags
     - `description` - Document description

2. **Verify Columns Added**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'documents' 
   ORDER BY column_name;
   ```

### Step 4: Install UUID Package (if not already installed)

```bash
cd backend
npm install uuid
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

1. **`backend/controllers/documentController.js`** ✅
   - Completely rewritten for Supabase Storage
   - Uses `supabase.storage.from('documents').upload()`
   - Uses `supabase.storage.from('documents').download()`
   - Stores metadata in database
   - Handles cloud file operations

2. **`backend/config/multerConfig.js`** ✅
   - Changed from disk storage to memory storage
   - Files now stored in `req.file.buffer` (Buffer object)
   - No more local filesystem writes

3. **`backend/config/schema-supabase.sql`** ✅
   - Added `storage_path`, `storage_bucket`, `file_size`, `mime_type`, `tags`, `description` columns

4. **`backend/scripts/setup-supabase-storage.sql`** ✅ NEW
   - Complete setup script for storage bucket and policies

### New Storage Structure:

```
Supabase Storage (documents bucket)
└── {facilityId}/
    ├── 1730204912510-uuid.pdf
    ├── 1730204914427-uuid.pdf
    └── 1730205123456-uuid.pdf

Database (documents table)
├── id: UUID
├── facility_id: UUID
├── name: "License Document"
├── file_name: "test_license.pdf"
├── storage_path: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001/1730204912510-uuid.pdf"
├── storage_bucket: "documents"
├── file_size: 524288
├── mime_type: "application/pdf"
└── ... other metadata
```

## 🧪 Testing the Migration

### Test 1: Upload Document
1. Navigate to Document Vault
2. Click "Upload Document"
3. Fill in form and select a PDF file
4. Click "Upload"
5. ✅ Should see success message
6. ✅ Check Supabase Storage → documents bucket → should see file
7. ✅ Check documents table → should see metadata record

### Test 2: Download Document
1. In Document Vault, find an uploaded document
2. Click the download icon/button
3. ✅ File should download successfully
4. ✅ File should open correctly

### Test 3: Persistence Test
1. Upload a document
2. Restart the application/server
3. ✅ Document should still be visible
4. ✅ Document should still be downloadable

### Test 4: View Documents
1. Upload 2-3 documents in different categories
2. ✅ All documents should appear in the list
3. ✅ Grouping by category should work
4. ✅ Expiring/expired badges should show correctly

---

## 📊 API Endpoints (No Changes Required)

The API endpoints remain the same - only the backend implementation changed:

- `GET /api/facilities/:facilityId/documents` - List documents
- `POST /api/facilities/:facilityId/documents/upload` - Upload document
- `GET /api/documents/:documentId` - Get document details
- `GET /api/documents/:documentId/download` - Download document

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication:
- All endpoints require authentication via `authenticateToken` middleware
- Only authenticated users can upload/download

### Authorization:
- Storage policies restrict access to authenticated users
- Files are organized by facilityId
- Future enhancement: Can add RLS policies to restrict by facility

### File Validation:
- File type validation (PDF, images, Word, Excel only)
- File size limit: 10MB
- Malicious file detection via MIME type checking

---

## 💾 Storage Limits

### Supabase Free Tier:
- Storage: 1 GB
- Bandwidth: 2 GB/month

### Estimated Capacity:
- Average PDF: ~500 KB
- 1 GB = ~2,000 PDFs
- Sufficient for most childcare facilities

### If You Exceed Limits:
- Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month)
- Pro includes: 100 GB storage, 200 GB bandwidth

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Created `documents` storage bucket in Supabase
- [ ] Ran setup SQL script (`setup-supabase-storage.sql`)
- [ ] Verified storage policies are active
- [ ] Tested document upload
- [ ] Tested document download
- [ ] Tested document persistence across restarts
- [ ] Verified no console errors
- [ ] Checked Supabase logs for any storage errors

## 🔄 Migrating Existing Files (Optional)

If you have existing files in `/uploads/` that need to be migrated:

1. **Manual Migration** (for small number of files):
   - Re-upload each document through the UI
   - This will store them in Supabase Storage

2. **Automated Migration** (for many files):
   - Create a migration script (can provide if needed)
   - Reads from `/uploads/`
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage
   - Updates database records
