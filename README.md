## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customization Options

The application can be customized by modifying variables in the `<script>` section:

```javascript
// Facility Information
const FACILITY_NAME = "Bright Futures Child Care";
const FACILITY_LICENSE = "TX-CC-123456";
const FACILITY_ADDRESS = "123 Main St, Austin, TX 78701";

// Compliance Thresholds
const COMPLIANCE_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 85;
const COMPLIANCE_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 70;

// Colors (modify in CSS)
:root {
    --primary-color: #3b82f6;
    --success-color: #22c55e;
    --warning-color: #f59e0b;
    --danger-color: #ef4444;
}
