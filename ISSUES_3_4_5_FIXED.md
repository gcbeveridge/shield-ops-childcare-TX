# Issues #3, #4, #5 - Fixed

## Summary of Fixes

All three remaining issues have been resolved:

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #3: CSV Template Download - FIXED

**Problem:** Clicking "Download Template" downloaded `staff-import-template.html` instead of a CSV file.

**Root Cause:** The `/templates/` directory wasn't being served by the Express server.

**Solution:** Added static file serving for the templates directory in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
// Serve templates folder for CSV downloads
app.use('/templates', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'templates')));
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server.js` - Added templates directory serving

**Testing:**
1. Navigate to Staff Management
2. Click "Import Staff" button
3. Click "üì• Download CSV Template"
4. ‚úÖ Should download `staff-import-template.csv` (valid CSV file)
5. Open in Excel/Sheets - verify it has proper headers and sample data

## ‚úÖ Issue #4: Compliance Rate Card - FIXED

**Problem:** Dashboard compliance card showed "Texas DFPS Certified" instead of "Texas HHS Certified"

**Why This Matters:** Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) is the correct regulatory agency name. DFPS is a division within HHS but for childcare licensing, the proper attribution is HHS.

**Solution:** Updated the compliance card text in dashboard.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/public/partials/screens/dashboard.html` - Changed "Texas DFPS Certified" to "Texas HHS Certified"

**Location:** Dashboard hero section, Compliance Rate card (middle stat)

**Testing:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Look at the three hero stat cards at the top
3. Middle card (Compliance Rate) should show:
   - ‚úÖ "Texas HHS Certified" (not DFPS)

## ‚úÖ Issue #5: Sidebar Username - FIXED

**Problem:** Sidebar showed "John Doe" placeholder instead of the actual logged-in user's name. Welcome message at top showed correct name (Maria) but sidebar showed placeholder.

**Solution:** Made the sidebar user section dynamic by:
1. Changed hardcoded "John Doe" to dynamic ID elements
2. Added `updateSidebarUserInfo()` function to populate user name and avatar
3. Called this function after login, signup, and page load

**Files Modified:**
1. `backend/public/partials/sidebar.html`
   - Changed static "JD" and "John Doe" to dynamic elements with IDs
   - Added `id="sidebar-user-name"` and `id="sidebar-user-avatar"`

2. `backend/public/js/app.js`
   - Added `updateSidebarUserInfo()` function
   - Generates initials from user's name (e.g., "Maria Garcia" ‚Üí "MG")
   - Called after login, signup, and page load

**How It Works:**
- Reads user name from `AppState.user.name` (or email if no name)
- Updates sidebar with actual user's name
- Generates 2-letter initials for avatar circle
- Updates automatically on login/signup

**Testing:**
1. Log in as any user (e.g., Maria Garcia)
2. Look at bottom of sidebar (left side of screen)
3. ‚úÖ Should show actual user name (not "John Doe")
4. ‚úÖ Avatar circle should show initials (e.g., "MG" for Maria Garcia)
5. ‚úÖ Top of dashboard should also show matching welcome message

## Additional Note: Schema Update Question

**Question:** "Do I need to update the schema for the new certification fields?"

**Answer:** ‚ùå **NO** - The staff table already has a `certifications` JSONB column that stores all certification data as flexible JSON. The new certification fields (Background Check, TB Test, Pre-Service Training, Annual Training, Health Statement) automatically work without any database schema changes.

The JSONB column type in PostgreSQL/Supabase allows storing any JSON structure, so you can add new certification fields without modifying the database schema.
