# Incident Logging Fixes - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Module:** Incident Tracking & Reporting  
**Status:** All Issues Resolved ✅

---

## Issues Reported & Fixed

### Issue 1: Incident Details Display Problems ✅
**Symptoms:**
- Child name showing as "unknown" at the top of incident details modal
- "Reported By" field showing "unknown" 
- "Immediate Action Taken" field not displaying properly

**Root Cause:**
- Database schema mismatch between frontend and Supabase
- Database uses snake_case: `child_info`, `reported_by`, `immediate_actions`
- Frontend code only checked for camelCase: `childInfo`, `reportedBy`, `immediateActions`

**Solution:**
Updated `viewIncidentDetails()` function to check both naming conventions:
```javascript
const reportedBy = incident.reported_by || incident.reportedBy || '—';
const immediateActions = incident.immediate_actions || incident.immediateActions || 'None specified';
const childName = incident.child_info?.name || incident.childInfo?.name || 'Unknown';
```

**Result:** All fields now display correctly with proper data

---

### Issue 2: Delete Button Not Working ✅
**Symptoms:**
- Clicking Delete button in incident modal caused JavaScript errors
- Unable to delete incidents from system

**Root Cause:**
- `confirmDeleteIncident()` tried to access `currentIncidentData.childInfo.name`
- Database returns `child_info.name` (snake_case)
- Caused undefined property error

**Solution:**
Updated `confirmDeleteIncident()` to handle both schemas:
```javascript
const childName = currentIncidentData.child_info?.name || 
                  currentIncidentData.childInfo?.name || 
                  'this child';
```

**Result:** Delete button works correctly, shows proper confirmation message

---

### Issue 3: Print Function Not Working ✅
**Symptoms:**
- Print button caused errors or printed incorrect data

**Root Cause:**
- Same schema mismatch issue affecting printed report data

**Solution:**
Updated `printIncidentReport()` to extract fields correctly:
```javascript
const dateTime = new Date(currentIncidentData.occurred_at || currentIncidentData.dateTime);
const childName = currentIncidentData.child_info?.name || currentIncidentData.childInfo?.name || 'Unknown';
const reportedBy = currentIncidentData.reported_by || currentIncidentData.reportedBy || 'Unknown';
const immediateActions = currentIncidentData.immediate_actions || currentIncidentData.immediateActions || 'None';
```

**Result:** Print function generates correct reports ready for parent signatures

---

### Issue 4: Export Report Button Not Implemented ✅
**Symptoms:**
- "Export Report" button (top right) did nothing when clicked
- Function referenced but never created

**Root Cause:**
- `exportIncidentReport()` function was missing from codebase
- Was in original scope but not completed

**Solution:**
Created complete `exportIncidentReport()` function:
- Fetches all facility incidents from API
- Generates CSV with proper headers and data
- Handles special characters and quote escaping
- Downloads with timestamped filename

**CSV Columns Exported:**
1. Date
2. Time
3. Child Name
4. Type (Injury/Illness/Behavior/etc.)
5. Severity (Critical/Major/Moderate/Minor)
6. Location
7. Description
8. Immediate Actions
9. Reported By
10. Parent Notified (Yes/No)
11. Parent Signed (Yes/No)

**Result:** Fully functional CSV export for compliance audits

---

### Issue 5: Recent Incidents Not Displaying ✅
**Symptoms:**
- After initial fixes, incident table was empty
- No incidents showing up on screen

**Root Cause:**
- Application has TWO incident screen files:
  - `incidents.html` (old screen) - uses `.data-table tbody` selector
  - `incidents-new.html` (new CAC design) - uses `#incidents-table-body` ID
- Updated code only worked with new screen
- App was loading old screen, so selector didn't match

**Solution:**
Updated `loadIncidentList()` to support both screens:
```javascript
// Find table in either old or new screen structure
const tbody = document.getElementById('incidents-table-body') || 
              document.querySelector('#incidents .data-table tbody');
```

Also updated:
- Badge classes to work with old screen (removed `cac-` prefixes)
- Empty state to calculate correct column count
- Table structure to match old screen layout

**Result:** Incidents display correctly on both old and new screens

---

### Issue 6: List/Timeline Buttons Not Responding ✅
**Symptoms:**
- Clicking List or Timeline buttons did nothing
- No visual feedback or view changes

**Root Cause:**
- `toggleIncidentView()` looked for view containers that only exist in new screen
- Old screen has buttons but no separate `#incidents-list-view` or `#incidents-timeline-view` divs
- Function silently failed when elements didn't exist

**Solution:**
Enhanced `toggleIncidentView()` to:
1. Detect which screen structure is present
2. For new screen: Toggle between existing view containers
3. For old screen: 
   - Dynamically create timeline container when Timeline clicked
   - Show/hide table vs timeline
   - Populate timeline with incident data
4. Update button states (highlight active view)

```javascript
if (view === 'timeline') {
    tableContainer.style.display = 'none';
    
    if (!timelineContainer) {
        // Create timeline container dynamically
        timelineContainer = document.createElement('div');
        timelineContainer.id = 'incidents-timeline';
        incidentsCard.appendChild(timelineContainer);
        loadIncidentList(currentIncidentFilter); // Populate it
    } else {
        timelineContainer.style.display = 'block';
    }
}
```

**Result:** Both List and Timeline views fully functional on both screens

## Database Schema Reference

Supabase `incidents` table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  facility_id UUID,
  type VARCHAR(50),              -- injury, illness, behavior, etc.
  severity VARCHAR(20),           -- critical, major, moderate, minor
  child_info JSONB,               -- { name, age }
  location VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  immediate_actions TEXT,         -- snake_case ✓
  occurred_at TIMESTAMP,
  reported_by VARCHAR(255),       -- snake_case ✓
  parent_notified BOOLEAN,
  parent_signature JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Backwards Compatibility

All fixes maintain backward compatibility:
- ✅ Checks both `snake_case` and `camelCase` field names
- ✅ Falls back to alternative if primary not found
- ✅ Won't break if data format changes
- ✅ Works with existing incidents in database
- ✅ Supports both old and new screen designs

Example pattern used throughout:
```javascript
const fieldValue = incident.snake_case_field || incident.camelCaseField || 'Default';
```
