# 📝 NOTES

## Deferred Items
- **Database Connection:** Waiting for correct Supabase credentials from client
- **PDF Parsing:** Decision pending - build now or wait for user feedback?

## Risks
- ⚠️  Database connection issue may delay backend testing
- ⚠️  Monolithic frontend (5,269 lines) makes debugging slower
- ⚠️  No automated tests increases regression risk

## Mitigation Strategies
- ✅ Focus on frontend fixes first (don't need DB)
- ✅ Test thoroughly in browser DevTools
- ✅ Use mock data for testing
- ✅ Document all changes in this file
