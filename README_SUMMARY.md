# Shield Ops – Project Summary

## Executive Overview
Shield Ops is now a fully modernized Texas child-care compliance platform. The application delivers real-time dashboards, automated documentation workflows, and AI-assisted regulation support to help facilities stay audit-ready. The October 2025 effort brought the codebase from an early prototype to a production-ready solution aligned with the CAC design language and Supabase-first backend.

## Delivery Milestones
- **Phase 1 – Responsive Foundation**
  - Refactored global layout into modular partials and CAC component library.
  - Made every page mobile-first with adaptive navigation, hero layouts, and modal behavior.
  - Hardened authentication, role redirects, and session handling.
- **Phase 2 – Data Integrity & Supabase Migration**
  - Replaced legacy Replit storage pipelines with Supabase, including schema scripts and seeding utilities.
  - Implemented document vault repairs, mocked data cleanup, and automated backfills for regulations.
  - Authored operating guides (REGULATION_PARSER_GUIDE.md, SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for ongoing maintenance.
- **Phase 3 – Experience Polish & Launch Readiness**
  - Delivered dashboard redesign, quick-action workflows, and Shield AI chat enhancements.
  - Finalized medication/staff onboarding templates, CSV import UX, and incident workflow fixes.
  - Completed UI refinements, accessibility tweaks, and QA playbooks across all app modules.

## Technical Highlights
- Node.js/Express API with modular controllers, services, and middleware for authentication and validation.
- CAC design system layered over vanilla JS SPA for consistent typography, theming, and micro-interactions.
- Supabase/PostgreSQL schema with migration scripts, seeding automation, and documentation of table contracts.
- Automated loaders, skeleton states, and toast notifications to signal async operations.
- Responsive navigation with body scroll locking, mobile overlays, and hamburger state syncing.

## Current UX Snapshot
- Hero dashboard cards deliver condensed metrics with reduced padding for small screens.
- Quick actions render in a two-column grid (1-up on narrow devices) with compact iconography.
- Mobile main content inherits gradient backgrounds, while overlays receive blur and scroll locking for focus.

## Artifacts & Documentation
- **Project Planning:** `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md`, `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`, `PHASE_2_PLAN.md`, `PHASE_2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Operational Guides:** `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`, `REGULATION_PARSER_GUIDE.md`, `DOCUMENT_VAULT_FIX_COMPLETE.md`, `UI_REFINEMENT_SUMMARY.md`.
- **Data Assets:** CSV templates under `templates/`, migration SQL in `backend/config/`, auto-seed scripts in `backend/scripts/`.
- **Frontend Assets:** CAC component CSS, responsive styles, modular partials under `backend/public/partials/`.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Provision production Supabase project and run the provided migration scripts.
2. Configure environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) for both API and seeding scripts.
3. Execute smoke tests across authentication, documents, incidents, training, and dashboard modules.
4. Establish monitoring/alerting for Supabase functions and storage quotas.

With all primary milestones and documentation delivered, the Shield Ops repository is ready for handoff or future expansion into additional compliance regions.
