I need you to enhance the existing Document Vault feature in my Shield Ops 
child care compliance app. DO NOT change the overall app structure or other 
features - ONLY update the Document Vault section.

CONTEXT:
This is a compliance management app for Texas child care facilities. The 
Document Vault helps facilities track required forms, certifications, and 
documents with automatic expiration tracking. The current version works but 
needs enhancements to match Texas DFPS requirements.

CURRENT STATE:
- Tabs: All Documents (94), Staff Certs (45), Facility (15), Insurance (8), 
  Children (26)
- Expiration alerts showing: Expired, Expiring in 30 Days, Current
- Document table with: Name, Category, Owner/Subject, Issue Date, Expiration 
  Date, Status, Actions
- Search bar and Upload Document button
- Works well but missing critical Texas compliance features

REQUIRED ENHANCEMENTS:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. UPDATE CATEGORY TABS

Change the existing tabs to:
- All Documents (94)
- Licensing & Permits (NEW - add this tab)
- Staff Records (rename from "Staff Certs")
- Children (26)
- Health & Safety (NEW - add this tab)
- Facility & Inspections (rename from "Facility")
- Insurance (8)

Keep the same tab styling and layout, just update the names and add 2 new tabs.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2. ADD FORM NUMBER TRACKING

In the document table, add a new column between DOCUMENT NAME and CATEGORY:
- Column header: "FORM #"
- Shows form number like "2971", "7255", "2910", etc.
- Should be sortable
- Make it narrow width (60-80px)

Updated table columns in this order:
DOCUMENT NAME | FORM # | CATEGORY | OWNER/SUBJECT | ISSUE DATE | EXPIRATION 
DATE | STATUS | ACTIONS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

3. ADD VIOLATION WEIGHT INDICATORS

Next to the STATUS badge, add a small badge showing violation weight:
- HIGH (red) - Missing this = serious violation
- MED-HIGH (orange)
- MEDIUM (yellow)
- MED-LOW (light yellow)
- LOW (gray)

Style: Small badge, subtle, doesn't overwhelm the status

Example row appearance:
CPR Certification | 2971 | Staff Records | Emily Rodriguez | Nov 15, 2023 | 
Nov 15, 2025 | [Exp 12 days] [MED-HIGH] | [Renew]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5. ADD "MISSING REQUIRED FORMS" DETECTION

Below the expiration alerts, add a new alert section:

[📋 Missing Required Forms]
[12 required documents are not on file - Add them now]

When clicked, shows a modal with:
"Missing Required Documents for Bright Futures Learning Center"

Grouped by category:
□ LICENSING & PERMITS (2 missing)

  □ Sanitation Inspection Report
  [etc...]

Each item has an [+ Add Document] button that opens the upload modal with 
pre-filled form information.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

6. ADD INSPECTION READINESS BUTTON

Next to "+ Upload Document" button, add:
[📊 Inspection Readiness Report]

[Print Report] [Email Report] [Close]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

7. ENHANCE SEARCH & FILTER

Update the search bar to include advanced filters:

Search bar with filter dropdown:
🔍 [Search documents...] [▼ Filters]

Filter options when clicked:
□ Status

- Change Category

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

9. IMPROVE EXPIRATION ALERT CARDS

Current cards show: 2 Expired | 3 Expiring in 30 Days | 89 Current

Enhance to be clickable and more detailed:

[🔴 2 Expired]
CPR Cert (Emily R.) - 12 days overdue
Fire Inspection - 5 days overdue
[View All Expired →]

[🟡 3 Expiring in 30 Days]

Clicking any card filters the table to show only those documents.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

10. ADD QUICK STATS AT TOP

Above the tabs, add a stats bar:

Document Vault 📁
Centralized storage with automatic expiration tracking

[Quick Stats]
Total Documents: 94 | Required: 82 | Missing: 12 | Compliance: 87%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Use existing React components and styling
- Store documents in Replit Database with these fields:
  * id, documentName, formNumber, category, violationWeight, issuedDate, 
    expirationDate, associatedWith, ownerSubject, status, fileUrl, 
    uploadedDate, facilityId
- Calculate status dynamically:
  * Current = expiration > 30 days from today
  * Expiring Soon = expiration <= 30 days from today
  * Expired = expiration < today
- Auto-categorize based on form number when possible
- Auto-assign violation weight based on form number (use this mapping):
  * Forms 2971, 2910, 7239, Current License = HIGH
  * Forms 2985, 7250, 7255 = MEDIUM-HIGH
  * Forms 7243, 7259, 7260, 7263 = MEDIUM
  * Most others = MEDIUM-LOW or LOW
- Keep all existing functionality working (don't break current features)
- Use consistent color scheme: Red (expired), Yellow (expiring), Green (current)
- Make it mobile responsive

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TESTING CHECKLIST:

After implementation, verify:
✓ All 7 tabs display correctly
✓ Form number column appears and sorts
✓ Violation weight badges display
✓ Upload modal has all fields and validation
✓ Missing forms detection works
✓ Inspection readiness report generates
✓ Search and filters work
✓ Expiration alerts are clickable
✓ Quick stats calculate correctly
✓ Existing documents still display
✓ Other app sections unchanged

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STYLE NOTES:

- Keep the existing blue color scheme (#4F46E5 or similar)
- Status badges: 
  * Expired = red background, white text
  * Expiring = yellow/orange background, dark text
  * Current = green background, white text
- Violation weight badges: Small, subtle, don't overpower status
- Modal: Clean, white background, good spacing
- Buttons: Primary (blue), Secondary (gray), Danger (red)
- Typography: Keep existing font family and sizes

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

START WITH:
1. Update the tabs first (add Licensing and Health & Safety)
2. Add Form # column to table
3. Then work on upload modal enhancement
4. Then add missing forms detection
5. Finally add inspection readiness report

Do this incrementally and create checkpoints after each major change so we 
can roll back if needed.
