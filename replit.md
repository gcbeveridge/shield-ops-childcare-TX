```

## Development
The application runs on a Python HTTP server configured to:
- Serve static files from the project root
- Bind to 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit compatibility
- Send cache control headers to prevent caching issues
- Auto-reload on file changes via workflow restart

### Running Locally
The workflow is configured to automatically start the server with:
```bash
python server.py
```

### Deployment
The application is configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:
- Deployment target: Autoscale (stateless web app)
- Run command: `python server.py`
- No build step required

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Styling:** CSS custom properties for theming, responsive grid layouts
- **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript for navigation, modals, and UI interactions
- **Design:** Purple gradient theme with modern card-based UI

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

### Known Limitations (Prototype)
- No backend persistence (data resets on page reload)
- Authentication is simulated (no real validation)
- All data is hardcoded demo data
- File uploads are UI-only (no actual file handling)
- No real API integrations

## User Preferences
None specified yet.

## Future Enhancements (Suggestions)
To convert this prototype into a production application, consider:
1. Backend API for data persistence (Node.js/Python/Ruby)
2. Database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
3. Real authentication system (OAuth, JWT)
4. File storage service for document uploads
5. Email/SMS notification system
6. Reporting and analytics
7. Mobile app version
8. Multi-facility support
9. Role-based access control
10. Integration with state licensing databases
